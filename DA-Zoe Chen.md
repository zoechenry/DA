- Based on the average 'Engagement Rate' corresponding to different days of the week and hours, it appears that both the day of the week and the time of posting do affect engagement rates.

- Specifically, higher engagement rates are observed when posting on **Saturday and Monday** compared to other days of the week. Additionally, posting at **5am** results in a significantly higher 'Engagement Rate' compared to other time periods.

## 3

- In terms of overall social performance, the game titles maintain an Engagement Rate within the range of 3% to 10%. Among them, **the game title 'General' stands out with the highest social performance**, indicated by the highest Engagement Rate and the highest Total Impressions provided by the company.

- Due to 'CSGO' being a key game for the company, it is suggested to focus on **improving conversion rate from Impressions to Engagement rather than decreasing impressions for 'CSGO'**. 
  - 'CSGO' ranks second in Total Impressions, significantly higher than other games. However, its Engagement Rate is remarkably low, less than 45% of the Engagement Rate of the 'General' game and lower than games with lower Total Impressions. This indicates the need to address the conversion issue from Impressions to Engagement for 'CSGO'.
- Additionally, efforts should be made to **increase the impression for 'DOTA2'**.
  - 'DOTA2' has a relatively high Engagement Rate among these games. However, its Total Impressions are much lower compared to 'General' and 'CSGO'. Therefore, efforts should be made to increase the impression for 'DOTA2'.

## 4.

- **'Photo' performs the best.**

- 'Photo' ranks second in terms of Total Impressions and Engagement Rate(9.07%). Although 'Album' has the highest Engagement Rate of 40%, its Total Impressions are too low, if a large number of impressions are generated for 'Album', the corresponding engagement rate for it would be unknown. Therefore, it is considered that 'Photo' performs the best.

## 6.

Defining posting strategies with following aspects:

- **Posting Time**
  -  Allocate the highest volume of posts to Monday and Saturday, with a focus on posting the most during the 5AM time slot.

- **Game Titles**
  -  Increase the impression posts for 'DOTA2' to enhance its exposure and reach. 
  - As 'CSGO' has a high total impression count, indicating its importance, analyze the conversion from impressions to engagement specifically for 'CSGO'.
    -  For example, assess the performance of 'CSGO' posts across different media types and allocate more impressions to the media types that yield better conversion results.

- **Media Types**
  - Currently, 'Text' has low impressions but a high conversion rate, so consider increasing impressions for this type. 
  - Carousel, on the other hand, has high impressions but a low conversion rate, so it may be beneficial to reduce impressions for this type. 
  - Maintain the current posting strategy for Mixed, Photo, and Video channels, as they have shown favorable performance.

- **Campaign Name**
  - Increase the number of impression posts for the 'Community Engagement' campaign. This campaign has demonstrated positive engagement rates, making it worth investing more impressions in.

## 7.

When considering expanding from YouTube to TikTok, it is important to evaluate the following aspects:

- **Consistency of target audience**
  - Assess whether the target audience on TikTok aligns with the current audience on YouTube. TikTok primarily caters to a younger demographic with a preference for short-form videos. Determine if TikTok can attract the desired target audience.

- **Competitors' performance on TikTok**

Pay attention to their performance, advertising strategies, and conversion rates. Learn from their experiences and understand market competitiveness.

- **Evaluation of operational capabilities**
  - Assess your team's ability to effectively operate on TikTok. TikTok has its own unique approach, including short-form videos and traffic pools. Ensure that your team has the skills to produce high-quality short videos and manage TikTok campaigns effectively. Alternatively, consider partnering with external MCN agencies to enhance your TikTok operations.

- **Identify unique selling points on TikTok**
  - Determine how your company can stand out on TikTok by highlighting unique, attractive, and creative elements that resonate with the platform's audience and your company's target audience.

- **Familiarize with TikTok's advertising data analytics tools**
  - TikTok offers robust advertising analytics tools. Learn how to use these tools effectively to monitor performance and make timely adjustments to your advertising strategy.

- **Consider posting costs**
  - Understand the cost of advertising on TikTok and develop a budget based on competitors' performance and market conditions. This will help ensure that your advertising investments are reasonable and aligned with your objectives.
